// script.js (archived placeholder)
// The Firebase-based materials loader has been archived and moved to
// /archive/script-firebase.js to avoid accidental execution. The site
// now uses Supabase for the materials page.

// If you want to re-enable Firebase Storage, restore the original
// code from /archive/script-firebase.js and replace the placeholders
// with your project config. For now this file is intentionally inert.
